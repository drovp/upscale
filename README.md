# @drovp/upscale

[Drovp](https://drovp.app) plugin for upscaling images with [waifu2x](https://github.com/nagadomi/waifu2x) neural network.

Uses [nihui/waifu2x-ncnn-vulkan](https://github.com/nihui/waifu2x-ncnn-vulkan) binaries under the hood.

NOTE: If you're getting GPU related or any errors at all, try setting the **GPU ID** option to `-1`, which switches waifu2x into a slower, but more reliable CPU mode.

## Changelog
